# 30 Days JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my JavaScript skills over the course of 30 days. Each day, I will be given a coding exercise to complete, along with detailed explanations and examples to guide you.

## Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - A comprehensive resource for JavaScript documentation.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript) - A popular Q&A platform where you can find answers to common JavaScript questions.

I hope you enjoy the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge and find it helpful in your journey to becoming a better JavaScript developer. Happy coding!
